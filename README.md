# Ninja-Challenge
In this repository I will be using basic JavaScript to get a ninja to move around with arrow key.
Some of the challenge was that I had to figure out how to move the character upwards 
and to adjust how far the character can move. After those two steps they gave me 7 other 
images to now make it look like the character is moving.
